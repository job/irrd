  The parser does not currently allow embedded comments in multi-line
non-freetext attributes.   Comments are allowed at the end
of attributes which do not contain multiple lines.

 For example,

route-set:  RS-FOO
members:   198.108.0.0/16,  #Merit
           35.0.0.0/8       #MSU

 is not allowed, but

route-set:  RS-FOO
members:   198.108.0.0/16  #Merit
members:   35.0.0.0/8      #MSU

 is okay.
