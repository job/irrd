Utility programs

== attr_tokens.pl ==

attr_tokens.pl uses rpsl.config as input to create data structures for the
parse.  It creates the tokens.rpsl file as output.  Run it like this:

./attr_tokens.pl rpsl.config

then look at tokens.rpsl and paste each section of code in to the indicated
source file.  Namely, rpsl.y and rpsl.fl in the irr_rpsl_check directory
will need to be updated.   Also, these files
will need to be updated to support syntax checking on any new attributes.

== create_templates.pl ==

obj_template [] uses the 'enum IRR_OBJECTS' data struct defined in scan.h as
its index.  Any changes to obj_template [] or 'enum IRR_OBJECTS' need to be
coordinated.

create_templates.pl uses rpsl.config to create the object templates used to
satisfy the '-t' IRRd command.  It reads from stdin and write to stdout.
Run it like this:

./create_templates.pl <rpsl.config

then paste the output in to the obj_template[] initializer in
../IRRd/templates.c.  'enum IRR_OBJECTS' in scan.h needs to be updated and
m_info [] in commands.c and key_info [] in scan.c need to be udpated also
(see 'enum IRR_OBJECTS' in scan.h for more information).

crypt_gen.c is a C-program which generates encrypted keys.

mailloop.pl is used in the pipeline call to irr_submit to detect mail loops
and take appropriate action.

ripe_subset.pl can take an allocation DB (eg, ripe) and filter the route
objects, thus reducing the DB size significantly (eg, for ftp export)
