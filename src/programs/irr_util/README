Utility programs

attr_tokens.pl uses rpsl.config as input to create data structures
for the parse.  It creates the tokens.rpsl file as output.

create_templates.pl uses rpsl.config to create the object templates
used to satisfy the '-t' IRRd command.  It reads from stdin and
write to stdout.  You should feed it rpsl.config and write the
outout to templates.rpsl.  See create_templates.pl for more
details.

crypt_gen.c is a C-program which generates encrypted keys. 

mailloop.pl is used in the pipeline call to irr_submit to detect
mail loops and take appropriate action.

ripe_subset.pl can take an allocation DB (eg, ripe) and filter
the route objects, thus reducing the DB size significantly (eg,
for ftp export)
