#  ------------------ IRRd Commands --------------------------

IRRd commands implemented:

B command 
	Build indexes command.
	Normally issued by 'irrdcacher' program.
	eg, !BRADB

g command
	Get routes with specified origin.
	eg, !gas1234

6 command
        Like the !g command, but return route6 objects
        with the matching origin AS instead
        eg, !6as237

i command with option 1
	Return members of an as-set/route-set.  Recursive
	lookup available.
	eg, !iAS-ESNETEU     	# non-recursive, don't expand any embedded sets
	eg, !iAS-ESNETEU,1   	# expand any embedded as-set/route-set's

i6 command with option 1
	Like !i, but return route6 objects

j command
	View the mirror status (oldest journal number, CURRENTSERIAL) for a db.

	If a : is present after the range, the database was last exported
	at that serial number.

	eg, !jRADB,RIPE,FOO,BAR
	eg, !j-*		# Show all databases

	Output:

	A<n>
	RADB:Y:1000-2000
	VERIO:Y:3500-4500:4000
	RIPE:N:0-666
	FOO:X:<explanatory text - optional>
	BAR:X:<explanatory text - optional>
	C

	Y means that the database is mirrorable.
	N means that the database is not mirrorable, but we're reporting
  	  the current serial number.  You can use this to check for updates.
  	  The first number will _always_ be zero.  The second number may be
  	  zero if the CURRENTSERIAL file doesn't exist.
	X means that the database doesn't exist, or we're denying information
  	  about an existing database for administrative reasons.

	Returned DB's are canonicalized to upper case.

m command
	Get the object with the specied key.
	!man, -- autnum
	!mmt, -- maintainer
	!mir, -- inet-rtr
	eg, !man,as1234

n command
	Identification of a tool (the name)
	!n<ascii text>
	eg !nroe

o command
	return all objects with the given mnt-by: attribute value.
	eg, !omaint-as237
	
q command
	Quit the IRRd session.
	eg, !q

r command with option l, o, L, M
	Route searches.
        Default finds exact prefix/len match.
        o - return origin of exact match(es)
        l - one-level less specific
	L - all less specific
	M - all more specific (must be /16 or longer prefix)
	eg, !r141.211.128/24,l

s command
	Set the sources to the specified list.
	  Default is all sources.
	  eg, !sradb,ripe
	lc - show the currently selected sources
	  eg, !s-lc

t command
	Set timeout on idle connections. This is for IRR GUI
        viewers (like ROE/AOE) 
        t<seconds>
	eg !t1000

u command
	Update the database
	!us<database> -- start update
	  <ADD | DEL> <OBJECT>
        !ue -- end update

uwd command
	Set the global withdrawn flag.
	!uwd=0 	do not include withdrawn routes
		in all route output commands (default).
	!uwd=1	include withdrawn routes in all
		route output commands.

v command
	Show the version.  This is the same replay as you'd get from the UII
	port.  Alternate commands:
	!v	-- Return a version string to identify the server
	!-v	-- Backwards compatibility
	!ver	-- For those who like the succinct but distinguishable
	version -- For people who like to type
	

IRRd treats each database (i.e. radb, ripe) as a
separate object. As a general algorithm, IRRd will scan each
database and return an answer from each.
